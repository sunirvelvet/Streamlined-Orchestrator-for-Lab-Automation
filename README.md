# SOLA: Streamlined Orchestrator for Lab Automation

This is a Hackathon Project for the AI in Motion Hardware Hackathon, This is not the entire codebase, we started to use Discord instead of Github cause one of the Team Members faced an authentication problem with Github: 2-factor authentication. 
Most of the ROS, Roomba operating code, and robot command code are with my teammates, Scott, and LLM-related code with Ameya and GPT, and chat functionality with Ally.



# We are solving the Real Problem: 
High costs of existing lab scheduling software 

Small labs are forced to spin up custom software due to cost & time investment.


#status quo
3 Major companies in the sector. Monopoly.
High knowledge barrier to entry->high product costs

Example Software:
Bioseroâ€™s Green Button Go Scheduler 
Costs:
Roughly $80k average installation
additional costs for custom hardware integration
Time:
6-month long initial consultations for setup


The significant commonality between laboratory automation hardware used: 60 of systems cover 80% of the market


#solution
Low- tech-overhead workflow lab automation software, using interoperable communication standards (SLIA2 and OPCUALADS)

Streamlined Interface for Custom Machine and Schedule Building

Community of Lab Automator Researchers to share configurations and process schedules


#economic incentive
Reduce average installation from $80k to $5k per customer.

Reduce setup time from 6+ months to 1 month.

Uncommon machines can be set up quickly with  shared configurations and process schedules

#next steps
Build towards full orchestration functionality

Dynamic scheduling at no additional cost to the consumer

LLM Chatbot to improve the speed of data entry for custom machine schedules.
